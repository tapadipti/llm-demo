How can I delete references from the server?,"You can use the refspec to delete references from the remote server by running something like this:

```
$ git push origin :topic
```
Because the refspec is <src>:<dst>, by leaving off the <src> part, this basically says to make the topic branch on the remote nothing, which deletes it. Or you can use the newer syntax (available since Git v1.7.0): 

```
$ git push origin --delete topic
